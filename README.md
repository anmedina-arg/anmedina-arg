### INDUSTRIAL ENGINEER | FULL STACK DEVELOPER

##### ABOUT ME

I am a proactive and responsible person. I like new challenges, research, study and learn new things. This has led me to train as a Full Stack Developer with main stack JavaScript and Node Js.
I developed my experience in the IT world at Henry's bootcamp, where I have carried out different projects, individually and as a team! In addition, he generated solid and important soft skills during his 12 years of experience as an Industrial Engineer where he led work teams, developing people in soft skills such as communication, feedback, inclusion, diversity, teamwork and continuous improvement.
